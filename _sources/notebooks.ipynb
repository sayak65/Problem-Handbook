    "\n",
    "A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. However, it is important to note that in the context of DNA, **directionality** plays a crucial role. Therefore, when assessing the palindromic nature of DNA sequences, one must consider the directional properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when manually inspecting DNA sequences for palindromic properties, we draw the reverse complement of the DNA sequence. THis allows us to visually compare both strands, ensuring they are identical when read from 5' to 3' direction.\n",
