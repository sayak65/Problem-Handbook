# Code With Subrata and Sayak

Programming is both fun and rewarding. We have all embarked on this journey from different starting points. 
However, any self-taught developer can attest to the challenges and obstacles encountered at the beginning. 
The vast array of resources available can often feel overwhelming for beginners.

> Hello, I am Sayak, just an ordinary guy with a passion for programming. This webpage is my way of giving back to the 
incredible programming community. My aim is to assist newcomers by guiding them and facilitating a seamless transition 
from *'non-coder'* to *'coder'*. While I plan to discuss about different programming concepts on this site,
for now, it will serve as a **problem handbook** for my dear juniors. I hope you find these problems intriguing and helpful.
